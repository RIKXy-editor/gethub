Alright, here’s the **clean, scope-locked REMOVAL + ADD prompt**.
This tells Replit **exactly what to remove**, **what to add**, and **what NOT to touch**. No wiggle room.

---

## ✅ FINAL REPLIT AI PROMPT — REMOVE IMAGE GEN, ADD LIVE MEMBER COUNT

**Copy–paste EVERYTHING below as ONE prompt:**

---

You are working on an **existing Discord bot project** built with **Node.js** and **discord.js v14**.

---

## 🔒 CRITICAL RULES (READ CAREFULLY)

* **REMOVE ONLY the image generation feature (`/generate`, Stable Diffusion, Nano Banana, or any image-related logic)**
* **DO NOT remove or modify any other existing features**
* **DO NOT refactor, rename, optimize, or restructure the project**
* After removal, **ADD the new feature described below**
* Keep changes **minimal and isolated**

---

## ❌ FEATURE TO REMOVE (ONLY THIS)

* Remove the **image generation feature completely**
* This includes:

  * `/generate` slash command
  * Image API calls
  * Rate limits related to image generation
  * Image-related environment variables (if unused)

⚠️ Do NOT touch anything else.

---

## ✅ FEATURE TO ADD

Add **ONE new feature only**:

### 🔁 Live Server Member Count in Bot Activity (Status)

---

## 🧠 BOT ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR

The bot’s activity (status) should:

* Display **live server member count**
* Rotate with **existing activity messages** (if any already exist)
* Update automatically when:

  * A member joins
  * A member leaves
  * Bot restarts

---

## 📊 ACTIVITY FORMAT (EXAMPLES)

Rotate between formats like:

* `👥 15,248 members`
* `📊 Members: 15.2K`
* Any **existing activity texts already in the bot**

Do NOT remove existing activity messages — only **add member count into the rotation**.

---

## ⚙️ TECH IMPLEMENTATION RULES

* Use existing activity/status system if present
* If activity rotation already exists:

  * Append member count as one of the rotation items
* If not:

  * Create a simple interval-based rotation
* Update activity without spamming Discord API
* Use `client.guilds.cache` to get member count
* Support large servers (use cached count safely)

---

## 🚫 ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

* Remove any other commands
* Change command behavior
* Add new slash commands
* Add image, AI, music, XP, economy features
* Change bot permissions
* Break existing activity logic

---

## 🎯 FINAL EXPECTATION

* Image generation feature is **fully removed**
* All other features remain **100% untouched**
* Bot activity shows **live server member count**
* Member count updates correctly and safely
* Existing activity rotation still works

---

This prompt **forces controlled removal + safe addition**.
If Replit still messes this up, the fix is manual (and fast).

If you want next, I can:

* add **smart formatting (1.2K / 15.3K)**
* handle **multi-server bots correctly**
* or make the activity **role-aware (VIP / Mods)**

Say what’s next.
