Add a Job Posting system to my Discord bot for a specific job-posting channel.

I want this flow:

1. In the job-posting channel, the bot should keep a single message with a button:
   - Label: "Post Job"
   - Style: Primary
   - Only ONE such message per channel. If deleted, recreate it.

2. When a user clicks "Post Job", open a Discord MODAL (like a form popup) with:
   - Modal title: "Post a Job"

   Fields (all required):
   - Text input 1:
     - Label: "Want"
     - Style: paragraph
     - Placeholder: "Example: Need an editor for gaming highlights…"
   - Text input 2:
     - Label: "Video Type"
     - Style: short
     - Placeholder: "YouTube / Reels / Shorts / Ads etc."
   - Text input 3:
     - Label: "Contract"
     - Style: short
     - Placeholder: "One-time / Monthly / Long-term"
   - Text input 4:
     - Label: "Budget"
     - Style: short
     - Placeholder: "e.g. $50 / video, 3k INR, Negotiable"

   This should work exactly like the standard Discord modal UI (like the Adobe example form).

3. After the user submits the modal, the bot posts a normal message in the SAME job channel with this template:

   Want: <Want>
   Video Type: <Video Type>
   Contract: <Contract>
   Budget: <Budget>

   DM <@user_who_submitted> for work with them.

   - The bot must actually mention/tag the user at the end.
   - Preserve the text exactly as submitted.

4. Extra features:
   - Send the user an **ephemeral** confirmation:  
     "Your job has been posted." + link to the message.
   - Add a **per-user cooldown** (e.g. 5 minutes) on using the "Post Job" button.  
     If they’re on cooldown, show an ephemeral message:  
     "You are on cooldown. Please wait before posting another job."
   - Add **optional role restriction**:
     - If a role ID is set in config, only users with that role can use the button.
     - If they don’t have permission, send an ephemeral error.
   - (Optional but preferred) Create a thread under each job post:
     - Name format: `Job: <first few words of Want> - <username>`
     - Add the job poster to that thread.

5. Config:
   - Job channel ID, allowed role ID (if any), log channel ID (if used), cooldown time should all be configurable in one place, not hardcoded everywhere.

6. Implementation:
   - Use Discord buttons + modals (no fake text-input flows).
   - Keep the rest of the bot untouched.
   - Use clean, modular code and proper error handling for interaction failures/timeouts.
