Build a production-ready Discord.js v14 bot feature (ESM Node.js) for my server.

Goal:
I have a channel named: #looking-for-clients
I want a STICKY MESSAGE system in this channel that always stays pinned at the bottom (auto reposts itself if new messages appear).

Sticky message rules embed content:
- No spam
- No fake portfolio
- No agencies

Sticky message requirements:
1) Must be an EMBED message (good looking).
2) Must contain one BUTTON (Primary / Blue):
   Label: "Share your work"
3) The sticky embed must re-post itself automatically (sticky behavior)
   - If someone sends a message and the sticky is no longer the last message, delete old sticky and re-send new sticky
   - Prevent spam / loops (cooldown)
   - Must remember the sticky message ID per guild/channel so it can update properly after restart
4) The sticky message should only operate in #looking-for-clients

When user clicks the button:
Open a Discord Modal form with title: "Share your work"
Modal fields (exact):
1) Name (required)
   placeholder: Rik
2) Role (required)
   placeholder: video editor
3) Experience (required)
   placeholder: 6 month+, 1yr+, 2yr+, 5yr+
4) Social Media (optional)
   placeholder: insta, yt, behance
5) Portfolio Link (required)
   placeholder: https://...
6) About Yourself (optional)
   placeholder: write something short
7) Profile Pic Image URL (optional)
   placeholder: https://image-link...

After submit:
- Generate a great looking EMBED message in the SAME channel (#looking-for-clients)
- The embed should include:
  - Title: "New Creator Submission"
  - Name, Role, Experience
  - Social Media (if provided)
  - Portfolio Link as clickable link
  - About Yourself (if provided)
  - Thumbnail or image using profile pic url if provided
  - Footer: "Posted via Client Form"
  - Timestamp
- Also tag the user in the message content: <@userId>

IMPORTANT:
- The sticky embed must stay sticky even after people submit forms.
- Sticky embed must NOT disappear.
- Sticky embed must always be the last message in the channel.
- When the submission embed is posted, re-post sticky embed after it so sticky stays at bottom.

Admin Commands:
1) /stickyclients setup
   - takes channel option (default #looking-for-clients)
   - posts the sticky embed and enables sticky mode
2) /stickyclients disable
   - disables sticky mode and deletes sticky embed
3) /stickyclients refresh
   - manually repost sticky

Storage:
- Use JSON persistence in ./data/
- Example file: data/stickyClients.json
- Store per guild:
  - channelId
  - stickyMessageId
  - enabled: true/false
  - cooldown timestamps

Project Structure (required):
- /commands/stickyclients.js
- /events/interactionCreate.js  (handle button + modal submit)
- /events/messageCreate.js      (sticky behavior)
- /utils/storage.js             (ensureDir/loadData/saveData)
- Must be Discord.js v14 ESM.

Quality rules:
- Fully working code, no pseudocode.
- Avoid infinite loops when reposting sticky message.
- Handle missing permissions safely.
- If channel not found or deleted, auto disable.
- Must be clean and readable.

Output:
Give me FULL code for all files with filenames and exact code blocks.
Do not skip anything.
