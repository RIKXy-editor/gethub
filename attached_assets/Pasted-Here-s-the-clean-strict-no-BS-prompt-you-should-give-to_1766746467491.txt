Here’s the **clean, strict, no-BS prompt** you should give to your bot builder.
This does **exactly** what you asked — nothing extra, nothing missing.

### ✅ FINAL BOT PROMPT (TTS ONLY, VC ONLY)

> Add a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that works **only in voice channels**.
>
> The bot must **NOT auto-join** any voice channel.
>
> Implement a `/join` slash command:
>
> * When a user runs `/join`, the bot must join **the same voice channel as the user**.
> * If the user is not in a voice channel, the bot must reply with an error message and not join.
>
> Implement a `/tts` slash command:
>
> * The bot must convert the provided text into speech using a **free, basic TTS engine**.
> * The bot must play the generated voice **only in the currently connected voice channel**.
> * If the bot is not connected to a voice channel, it must tell the user to use `/join` first.
>
> Apply strict limits:
>
> * Maximum 200 characters per TTS request.
> * Cooldown per user to prevent spam.
> * Strip @everyone, @here, links, and excessive emojis.
>
> The bot must:
>
> * Reuse the existing voice connection.
> * Stay in the voice channel after speaking.
> * Not leave unless manually disconnected or idle for a long time.
>
> Do **NOT** remove, change, or override any existing bot features.

## Why this prompt is correct (read this)

* `/join` = **manual control** → no random joins
* `/tts` works **only after joining** → predictable behavior
* VC-only → no chat spam, no audio files
* Limits → prevents abuse
* Free TTS → realistic expectations

If someone complains “bot didn’t speak”, the reason will be **user error**, not your system.

### One last reality check

If your builder:

* ❌ doesn’t allow voice connections
* ❌ doesn’t allow audio playback
* ❌ doesn’t allow external libraries

Then **this will not work**, no matter how good the prompt is.

Now answer **one thing clearly** so I can guide you properly next:
Are you deploying this bot on
**Replit free / Replit paid / VPS**?
