Update the Job Posting system of my Discord bot with these changes:

1) Job posting banner message + button
- In the job-posting channel, the bot should always keep ONE "banner" message at the bottom.
- This banner message must include:
  - A big title text, e.g.: **"Post Your Job Here"**
  - Some rules/instructions text, for example:

    **Rules for posting jobs:**
    - Be clear about what you want (no vague "need editor" only).
    - Mention video type (YouTube, Reels, Shorts, Ads, etc.).
    - Mention contract type (one-time / monthly / long-term).
    - Mention budget honestly (fixed / range / negotiable).
    - Add sample links (YouTube / Google Drive) so editors can see your style.
    - No fake jobs, no trolling, no spam.

  - Below this text, there should be the **"Post Job"** button (Primary style).

- This banner + button message must:
  - Always stay at the bottom of the channel.
  - After every job post, the bot should:
    - Post the job as a new message.
    - Then re-send the banner+button message below it, so the banner is again the last message.
    - Delete the old banner if needed so only ONE banner exists.
  - If someone deletes the banner manually, the bot should recreate it.

2) Job form (modal) – add "Sample Links" field
When a user clicks the "Post Job" button, open a modal with:

- Title: "Post a Job"

Fields (all required except samples):

1) Want (required)
   - Label: "Want"
   - Style: paragraph
   - Placeholder: "Example: Need a gaming highlights editor for 5 videos…"

2) Video Type (required)
   - Label: "Video Type"
   - Style: short
   - Placeholder: "YouTube / Reels / Shorts / Ads etc."

3) Contract (required)
   - Label: "Contract"
   - Style: short
   - Placeholder: "One-time / Monthly / Long-term"

4) Budget (required)
   - Label: "Budget"
   - Style: short
   - Placeholder: "e.g. 3000 INR / video, $50 / video, Negotiable"

5) Sample Links (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Label: "Samples (YouTube / Drive links)"
   - Style: paragraph
   - Placeholder: "Example: https://youtube.com/...  https://drive.google.com/..."

3) Job post message format
After the user submits the modal, the bot posts a NEW message in the same channel with this template:

Want: <Want>
Video Type: <Video Type>
Contract: <Contract>
Budget: <Budget>
Samples: <Sample Links or "Not provided">

DM <@user_who_submitted> for work with them.

- The bot must mention the user at the end.
- If the user did not fill "Samples", write something like: "Samples: Not provided".

4) Reactions on job post
- After posting the job message, the bot should automatically react with:
  - Green check mark (✔️ or ✅)
  - Red cross mark (❌)

5) Keep previous behavior (do NOT remove):
- Per-user cooldown (e.g. 5 minutes) on using the "Post Job" button. If on cooldown, send an ephemeral message.
- Ephemeral confirmation after a successful post, including a jump link to the job message.
- Optional role restriction: if a role ID is set, only users with that role can use the button; others get an ephemeral error.
- Optio
