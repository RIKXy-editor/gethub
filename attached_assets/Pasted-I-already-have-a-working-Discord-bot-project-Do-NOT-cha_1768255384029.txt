I already have a working Discord bot project.
Do NOT change or remove any existing features, commands, events, files, or code.
Do NOT refactor unrelated code. Do NOT rename existing commands. Do NOT change command handler structure.
Only ADD the new review system feature described below.

Goal: Add a Review System

I want a review system using a /feed slash command.

1) /feed command

Create a new slash command:

/feed

Options:

user (optional) = send review request embed to a specific user

role (optional) = send review request embed to a specific role

If neither user nor role is provided → reply with error message.

When /feed is used, bot must send an embed in the same channel:

Embed text:

Title: ✅ Thanks for purchasing Adobe subscription from us!

Description: We’d love to hear your feedback. Click below to share a review ⭐

Color: green

Footer: Your feedback helps us improve.

Under the embed add a green button:

Label: ⭐ Share Review

Button style: Success (green)

customId: review_start

2) When user clicks “⭐ Share Review”

Bot must reply ephemerally and show 5 rating buttons:

⭐ (customId: rate_1)

⭐⭐ (rate_2)

⭐⭐⭐ (rate_3)

⭐⭐⭐⭐ (rate_4)

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (rate_5)

User clicks one rating button.

3) After rating click → open Modal form

Open a Discord Modal with customId: review_modal

Modal Title: Share Your Review ⭐

Fields:

Subscription Plan (required)

placeholder: 1 month / 3 month / 6 month / 1 year

Review text (required)

paragraph input

Screenshot Link (optional)

NOTE: Discord does not allow uploading images in modal, so accept a LINK (imgur / discord CDN)

Extra note (optional)

4) After modal submit → post review in this channel

After submit, bot must post an embed in this review channel:

Channel ID: 1346744648198131752

Review embed must include:

Customer mention + user ID

Subscription Plan

Rating shown as stars

Review text

If screenshot link exists and starts with http → set it as embed image

Then reply ephemerally:
✅ Thanks! Your review has been submitted.

Important Requirements

Now implement this feature in my Replit project.
