Good. That’s finally a **clear requirement**. Now listen carefully, because this is where most people screw it up.

You want a **REAL TTS bot**, not a toy.

> **Behavior you want (corrected):**
> When a user is **in a voice channel** and **types a normal message in a specific text channel**, the bot **automatically speaks that message in the VC**.

No slash commands. No manual trigger. **Auto-speak.**

That’s doable — but only if you do it properly.

## Reality check (don’t ignore this)

* This **can get annoying FAST** if you don’t add rules.
* Without filters, cooldowns, and limits → your VC will become cancer.
* So we’ll design it **clean + controlled**.

---

## Core concept (simple logic)

### Trigger

* User sends a message in a **specific text channel** (example: `#vc-tts`)
* User **must be in a voice channel**

### Action

* Bot joins the user’s VC
* Converts message text → speech
* Plays audio
* Stays connected (or leaves after idle)

---

## Platform & stack (no overengineering)

* Platform: **Discord**
* Language: **Node.js**
* Library: `discord.js v14`
* Voice: `@discordjs/voice`
* TTS engine: **Edge TTS (FREE & good quality)**

If you try Python now, you’ll struggle more. Node.js is smoother for voice.

## Message flow (exact)

1. `messageCreate` event fires
2. Check ALL of these:

   * ❌ Message from bot → ignore
   * ❌ Message not in `#vc-tts` → ignore
   * ❌ User not in VC → ignore
   * ❌ Message too long → ignore
3. Convert text → audio
4. Play audio in the VC

That’s it. No magic.

## HARD RULES (non-negotiable)

If you skip these, your bot is trash.

### 1️⃣ Channel lock

Only read messages from **ONE text channel**

```
#vc-tts
```

### 2️⃣ Character limit

```
Max 150–200 characters
```

### 3️⃣ Cooldown

```
Per user: 10–15 seconds
```

### 4️⃣ Mention filter

Block:

```
@everyone
@here
<@user>
```

### 5️⃣ Queue system

If 2 people type together:

* Messages go in a queue
* Bot speaks one by one

No queue = audio overlap = disaster.

---

## Voice behavior (important)

* Bot joins **only once**
* Reuses the connection
* Leaves after **60–90 seconds idle**

If you join/leave every message → lag + rate limits.

---

## TTS Engine choice (final verdict)

### ❌ Discord TTS

* Robotic
* Trash

### ✅ Edge TTS (recommended)

* Free
* Natural voices
* No credit card
* Stable

Later you can upgrade to ElevenLabs if you want premium voices.

## Example real usage (what users will do)

**User is in VC “General”**
**Types in `#vc-tts`:**

```
bro start the stream in 5 minutes
```

**Bot speaks in VC:**

> “Bro, start the stream in five minutes.”

That’s a **proper TTS bot**.

---

## Brutal warning (read this twice)

If you let the bot:

* read every channel ❌
* read long paragraphs ❌
* read spam ❌

People will mute or kick it within a day.

---

## Next step (answer clearly)

Reply with **ONE word only**:

**`Node`** or **`Python`**

After that, I’ll give you:

* Exact event logic
* Folder structure
* Ready-to-use code (clean, not bloated)

No fluff. No guessing.
