Here’s a **perfect Replit prompt** you can copy-paste to generate this exact feature (Lockdown ON/OFF with 2–3 channels visible + restore original state).

## ✅ Replit Prompt (Copy Paste)

**Prompt:**

> Build a Discord bot using **Discord.js v14** with slash commands.
> I want an **Admin-only Server Lockdown system**.
>
> ### Features:
>
> 1. Slash command: `/lockdown enable`
>
> * Admin only
>
> * Must lock/hide the **entire server** for `@everyone` by setting these permissions in every channel:
>
>   * `ViewChannel: false`
>   * `SendMessages: false`
>   * `AddReactions: false`
>   * `Connect: false`
>   * `Speak: false`
>
> * But allow me to select **up to 3 channels** (channel1 required, channel2 optional, channel3 optional) that will remain visible for everyone (`ViewChannel: true`) during lockdown.
>
> 2. Slash command: `/lockdown disable`
>
> * Admin only
> * Must restore the server permissions back to the **exact previous state**.
>
> ### Important:
>
> * The bot must **backup the previous @everyone permission overwrites per channel** before enabling lockdown.
> * Store backups in a JSON file: `data/lockdown.json` (auto-create folder/file if missing).
> * While restoring, if a channel had no overwrite before, the bot should remove the overwrite when disabling.
>
> ### Output Requirements:
>
> * Provide complete production-ready code.
> * Include:
>
>   * `index.js` (bot login, interaction handler)
>   * `commands/lockdown.js` (the full lockdown system)
>   * Proper slash command registration
>   * `.env` usage (`DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, optional `GUILD_ID`)
> * Include steps to run on Replit.
>
> Make sure the command works on:
>
> * text channels
> * voice channels
> * categories
> * announcement channels
> * forums/media if possible
>
> Also make the bot reply with progress messages like “Lockdown enabled” and “Server restored”.

If you want, I can also write you a **shorter prompt** (faster generation) or a **Python version** prompt (py-cord / nextcord).
