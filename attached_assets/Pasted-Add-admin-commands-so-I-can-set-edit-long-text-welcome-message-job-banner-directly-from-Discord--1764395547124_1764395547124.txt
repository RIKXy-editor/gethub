Add admin commands so I can set/edit long text (welcome message + job banner) directly from Discord, using a "wait for next message" flow.

I want this behavior pattern:

- I run a command.
- The bot asks me for the new text.
- Then it waits for my next message in the same channel, from the same user.
- That reply becomes the stored text (multi-line, formatting preserved).
- If I type "cancel", it aborts.
- The bot stores the text and later uses it exactly as I typed it.

Implement this pattern for TWO things:

--------------------------------
1) Welcome embed description text
--------------------------------

Command example: `/setwelcome` or `!setwelcome`

Flow:
- Only admins (and server owner) can use this command.
- When I run the command, the bot sends:

  "Send the new welcome description text now.  
   It can be multi-line.  
   Type `cancel` to stop."

- Then it waits for my next message in the same channel, from the same user.
  - That reply (full message, multi-line) becomes the **welcomeDescription** template.
  - If I send `cancel` (case-insensitive), it aborts and keeps the old text.

- The welcome embed will then use this stored **welcomeDescription** every time a new member joins.
- The text must be stored somewhere persistent (JSON file, database, etc.) so it survives bot restarts.
- All formatting must be preserved exactly: line breaks, channel mentions, links, etc.
- Still allow these placeholders inside the stored text:
  - `{user}` -> mention or username of the new member
  - `{server}` -> server name
  - `{member_count}` -> member count

The bot should replace these placeholders when sending the welcome embed.

--------------------------------
2) Job banner text (the message above the "Post Job" button)
--------------------------------

Command example: `/setjobbanner` or `!setjobbanner`

Flow:
- Only admins (and server owner) can use this command.
- When I run the command, the bot sends:

  "Send the new Job Banner text now (the text above the Post Job button).  
   It can be multi-line.  
   Type `cancel` to stop."

- Then it waits for my next message in the same channel, from the same user.
  - That reply becomes the **jobBannerText** used in the job-posting channel above the Post Job button.
  - If I send `cancel`, abort and keep the old banner text.

- The bot must use **jobBannerText** exactly as typed (multi-line, bold, lists, etc.) when recreating the banner.
- Store this text persistently so it survives restarts.

--------------------------------
General rules for both commands
--------------------------------

- Use a message collector / interaction with a timeout (e.g. 60–120 seconds).  
  If the user doesn’t respond in time, cancel and send an info message.

- While waiting, only accept messages from:
  - the same user
  - in the same channel
- Ignore all other users/messages.

- After successfully saving the new text:
  - Send a short confirmation (e.g. "Welcome text updated." / "Job banner text updated.")
  - For the job banner: immediately update/re-send the banner in the job channel using the new text.

- No cooldown on these commands, but **restricted to admins + server owner** only.

- Do NOT break existing behavior of:
  - Welcome trigger on member join
  - Job posting modal + button + reactions + thread, etc.

Implement all this in the same language/framework the bot is already using.
