1️⃣ REMOVE BACKEND DASHBOARD COMPLETELY

• Remove all Express / web server logic
• Delete all routes, dashboard endpoints, sessions, web tokens
• Remove dashboard-related dependencies from package.json
• Ensure the bot runs ONLY as a Discord bot (no web server)
• Clean unused imports and configs

Do not touch other systems.

2️⃣ ADD PERSISTENT MEMORY TO TICKET SYSTEM

Currently, ticket panel settings reset after redeploy.

Implement persistent storage using SQLite (preferred) or a JSON database if SQLite is not already used.

Store:

Guild ID

Panel message ID

Panel channel ID

Category ID

Staff role ID

Payment configuration

Plan type

Subscription start date

Subscription duration

On bot startup:

Reload all stored panel settings

Reattach button interactions automatically

Do NOT require manual re-setup after redeploy

The ticket system logic must stay the same otherwise.

3️⃣ AFTER PAYMENT → EMAIL SUBMISSION BUTTON

Inside a ticket, once payment is confirmed:

• Send an embed:
Title: Payment Confirmed
Description: Please submit the email carefully for your subscription.

• Add a green button: “Submit Email”

When clicked:
• Open a Discord modal
• Modal title: Enter Subscription Email
• Add warning text: “Please enter your email carefully. Wrong email = wrong subscription delivery.”
• Required text input field for email

After submission:
• Save email in database linked to:

User ID

Plan

Start date

Ticket ID

Do not break existing ticket close system.

4️⃣ SUBSCRIPTION REMINDER SYSTEM

When user selects a plan (example: 1 month plan on January 1):

Store:

Plan type

Start date

End date

Create automated reminder logic:

For 1-month plan:

Send 1 DM per day for last 3 days before expiry
(Example: Jan 28, 29, 30 if ending Jan 31)

DM Embed:

Title: Subscription Ending Soon
Description:
"Hey there, your Adobe subscription is going to end soon."

Add green button:
Label: Resubscribe Now
URL: https://discord.com/channels/1153309880644554804/1415963231108861952

On final reminder day:
Add extra line in embed:
"🎉 Get 10% OFF on any subscription from 3 months to 1 year if you renew now!"

Reminders must:
• Work after bot redeploy
• Not duplicate DMs
• Automatically stop once expired
• Be scheduled properly (use node-cron or internal scheduler)

Do not rewrite existing systems unless necessary.
Keep code clean, modular, and production-ready.
