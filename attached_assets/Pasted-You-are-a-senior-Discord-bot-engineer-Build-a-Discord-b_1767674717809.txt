You are a senior Discord bot engineer.
Build a Discord bot using discord.js v14 with a persistent database (SQLite is acceptable).

GOAL:
Create a subscription reminder system for Adobe subscriptions with automated DM reminders, admin commands, and full logging.

GLOBAL RULES:
- All dates and times must be handled in UTC
- Store all subscription data persistently
- Handle DM failures gracefully and log them
- Use Discord Embeds for all user-facing messages
- Slash commands only
- Admin-only commands must be permission-gated

DATABASE SCHEMA:
Table: subscriptions
Fields:
- user_id (string, primary key)
- plan_type (enum: 1_month, 3_month, 6_month, 1_year)
- start_date (ISO timestamp, UTC)
- end_date (ISO timestamp, UTC)
- next_reminder_date (ISO timestamp, UTC)
- active (boolean)

SLASH COMMAND: /subadd
Permissions: Administrator

Options:
- user (User) [required]
- plan (Choice: 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month, 1 Year) [required]
- start_date (String, optional, format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)

LOGIC:
- If start_date is not provided, use current UTC datetime
- Calculate end_date based on plan:
  1 Month = +30 days
  3 Month = +90 days
  6 Month = +180 days
  1 Year = +365 days
- Set next_reminder_date = end_date - 4 days
- Save subscription to database (overwrite if user already exists)
- Send confirmation embed in the server
- Send DM to the user confirming subscription was added

CONFIRMATION EMBED (SERVER):
Title: Subscription Added
Fields:
- User
- Plan
- Start Date (UTC)
- End Date (UTC)

CONFIRMATION EMBED (DM):
Title: Adobe Subscription Activated
Description:
Your Adobe subscription has been activated.
Fields:
- Plan
- Ends On (exact UTC date & time)

---

AUTOMATED REMINDER SYSTEM:
Run a scheduler every 60 minutes.

For each active subscription:
- If current UTC time >= next_reminder_date AND end_date > now:
    - Calculate days_left = ceil((end_date - now) in days)
    - Send DM reminder embed
    - Update next_reminder_date += 4 days

REMINDER EMBED (DM):
Title: Adobe Subscription Expiring
Description:
Hey @user,
Your Adobe subscription will expire soon.

Fields:
- Days Remaining: X days
- Expiry Date & Time (UTC)
- Renew Link: https://discord.com/channels/1153309880644554804/1415963231108861952

Footer:
Renew to avoid service interruption.

---

SUBSCRIPTION ENDED SYSTEM:
If current UTC time >= end_date AND active = true:
- Mark subscription as inactive
- Send final DM

ENDED EMBED (DM):
Title: Subscription Ended
Description:
Your Adobe subscription has ended.
Renew now to regain access.

Include renew link.

---

SLASH COMMAND: /sublist
Permissions: Administrator

Function:
- Fetch all active subscriptions
- Calculate days remaining for each user
- Reply with an embed listing:
  User | Plan | Days Left | End Date (UTC)

Paginate if more than 10 entries.

---

ERROR HANDLING:
- If DM fails, log user_id and error to console
- Bot must never crash due to a DM failure

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- discord.js v14
- node-cron or custom interval scheduler
- SQLite via better-sqlite3 or equivalent
- Clean modular structure (commands, events, scheduler)

DO NOT:
- Use message commands
- Hardcode dates
- Ignore timezones
- Skip database persistence

DELIVERABLE:
Return full bot code with clear file structure and setup instructions.
